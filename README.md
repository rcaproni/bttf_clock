# Back to the Future clock

  ![Alt text](images/front.jpg?raw=true "Title")

Based on the design by jerome95 from [Instructables](https://www.instructables.com/Back-to-the-Future-Lamp-Clock/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email), I took on my first 3D printing project: a clock inspired by the *Back to the Future* DeLorean Time Circuits. This clock is controlled by an ESP32 Mini and syncs the time over the internet using an NTP client.

I'm a big fan of the BTTF trilogy. The first project I decided to tackle when I acquired a 3D printer was the clock designed by jerome95. The original project uses the aesthetics of BTTF's DeLorean Time Circuits. The clock is controlled by an ESP32 Mini and synchronizes the time over the internet using an NTP client.

For my design, I made some changes to the original:

- **Case modification for small printers**: The original case was too large for my Ender3, so I divided it into two parts using SketchUp. I added internal pins to ensure the two halves could be glued securely. The modified STL files are available in the 3D folder.

- **Display order**: I adapted the display format to the Brazilian time format: DD:MM YYYY AM/PM HH:MM.

- **ESP32 Board**: Since I couldnâ€™t find the ESP32 Mini locally, I used a NodeMcu 3.0 instead. Though I initially planned to use the same firmware, I made several changes to accommodate the new hardware.
- **RTC Integration**: I added an RTC module to keep the time accurate when the device is offline. This module is powered by a battery and can be configured through the web server. I made minor tweaks to the SlowSoftI2CMaster library to improve I2C communication by adding slight delays to the `i2c_init` and `i2c_start` functions.

- **Sacrificial pixel**: I added a sacrificial pixel to the LED string following [this guide](https://hackaday.com/2017/01/20/cheating-at-5v-ws2812-control-to-use-a-3-3v-data-line) to ensure proper 3.3V data line control.

- **Web Server**: Instead of using NTP sync, I implemented a web server based on [Kris Kasprzak's code](https://github.com/KrisKasprzak/ESP32_WebPage). The server allows users to configure the time and date, control LED and display brightness, and retrieve time data from the RTC. Clicking "Get Local Time" populates fields with the current time from the accessing device, while "Prog RTC Time" programs the RTC module. 
  - The configuration of the time and date is done by first clicking the "Get Local Time" button. This will fill the fields with the current time from the device where the web server is being accessed. Then, clicking the "Prog RTC Time" button will program the RTC module with the local time. The "Get RTC Time" button will retrieve the current time from the RTC.
  - The LED brightness and display brightness sliders will adjust the brightness of the LED strip and the time displays.
- *Scene Setup* is a work in progress, and my goal is to synchronize LED colors and brightness with the current time.
